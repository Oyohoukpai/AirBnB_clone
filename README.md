Description


Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how to:

create a Python package
create a command interpreter using the cmd module
serialize and deserialize a Class
write and read a JSON file
manage datetime
use *args and **kwargs
handle named arguments in a function
HTML and CSS concepts
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
